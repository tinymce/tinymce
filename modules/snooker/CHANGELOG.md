## Unreleased

### Added
- `Warehouse` now contains the colgroup elements from the table.
- `TableOperations` now includes functions to convert individual table cells to header cells (and vice-versa).
- Added new `makeRowBody`, `makeRowsBody`, `makeRowFooter` and `makeRowsFooter` APIs to the `TableOperations` module.
- Added a new `TableSection` module to control how table cells, rows, and sections are modified when moving rows to different sections.

### Improved
- Rows are now stored and tracked in the table model structures.

### Changed
- `RowDetails` has been renamed to `RowDetail` and now takes a generic argument to define the type of cells stored.
- `row` and `colgroup` generators are now passed the previous element during transform or modification operations.
- Renamed `getColType` to `getColsType` in the `TableOperations` module to reflect that it can lookup the type from multiple columns.
- The `getCellsType` in the `TableOperations` module has been changed to be consistent with the `getColsType` function.
- The `RunOperation` and `TableOperation` module now requires an object containing the optional table behaviours (e.g. sizing and resizing) instead of passing them as separate arguments.
- Upgraded to Katamari 8.0, which includes breaking changes to the `Optional` API used in this module.

### Fixed
- Table operations that replace all cells in a row now re-use the existing row instead of creating a new row.

### Removed
- `Structs.RowData` has been merged into and replaced by `Structs.RowDetail` to remove some duplication.
- The `cursor` function has been removed from `Generators` as it was unused and incorrectly implemented.
- `unmakeRowHeader` and `unmakeRowsHeader` APIs have been removed from the `TableOperations` module.

## 8.0.4 - 2021-06-23

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `TableMerge` that caused layout issues when merging cells from tables containing `colgroup`s into tables without `colgroup`s #TINY-6675
