/*
 * What is going on here, you ask?
 *
 * During patching, it is quite possible that an element is going to
 * be replaced by something which has the replacee as a child. In this
 * situation, we cannot insert before it, because it is already in the
 * tree. Therefore, we have to remove it first.
 *
 * I'm not sure whether we should just always do it in that order. There
 * is probably no harm, and it is likely a lot safer.
 *
 * However, this is going to fail in situations where the thing that is
 * getting put in new is not the obsoleted child, but a child further away.
 * Although, maybe the DOM just handles that? Let's see if we can get a test
 * case. It looks like the DOM handles most things that aren't insertBefore.
 * Though, I'm not sure about that.
 *
 * Let's run tests
 *
