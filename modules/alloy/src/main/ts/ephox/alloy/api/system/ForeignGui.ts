/*
 * ForeignGui is an experimental concept
 *
 * Essentially, the basic idea is that we want to be able to use alloy behaviours and events
 * on elements that were not created by alloy. The common example of this is the contents inside
 * an iframe of an editor. We did not create the content (it is also volatile), but we still
 * want to be able to pinch it, drag it, toggle it etc. However, we don't have Component
 * instances for any of these things inside the alloy root ... they are completely separate.
 *
 * Most behaviours (probably not all) require configuration and a connection to an alloy
 * root to exist for a small amount of time to execute their actions. For this reason, we
 * create an internal alloy root for this foreign object (and insert it using insertion, so
 * for iframes, it would often be inserted at the document level so that it wasn't in the content),
 * and connect and disconnect the external elements to that. The elements themselves store their
 * configuration so that we get garbage collecting benefits (a previous version stored them in
 * a separate map), and that configuration can be retrieved from the element. If it isn't there,
 * it is recreated (and any state with it). The configuration is maintained on the DOM object
 * itself (through DomState), and the connection to the internal alloy root (/system) is removed after
 * execution of the action.
 *
 * The connection to the internal alloy root can be required if the behaviour needs to create additional
 * components (e.g. blockers for dragging). However, because these components are already within
 * the internal alloy root, they don't need to be handled in this way (they are just maintained
 * like normal alloy components having been built by alloy). Therefore, we exit dispatching if the
 * target is within our internal system.
 *
 * A ForeignGui is setup with a list of dispatchers. Dispatchers tell alloy which things should have
 * alloy like behaviour. Note, that each dispatcher has a getTarget, which returns an option of element.
 * The purpose of this is it means that you may choose to add the behaviour to an *ancestor* of the target
 * element (e.g. table) rather than the target element itself (td). The alloyConfig lists the behaviours and
 * events to proxy for this dispatcher.
