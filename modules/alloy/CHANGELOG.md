- Fixed a number of positioning bugs when using an "inset" layout, especially any that renders at the bottom.
- `LayoutInset` bubble classes were applied incorrectly, causing the bubble arrows to show on the opposite side.
- `MakeshiftAnchorSpec` did not extend `HasLayoutAnchorSpec` which meant layouts couldn't be used for makeshift anchors.
- `TieredMenu` child menus were incorrectly opened when the parent menu item was disabled.
- Fixed selection box creation in `SelectionAnchor` to avoid context menu covering text when multiple lines are selected.
