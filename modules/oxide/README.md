# TinyMCE Oxide skin tools
This project contains the default skins as well as tools and files needed to build your own skin for TinyMCE 7.

Visit the [TinyMCE 7 documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/7/creating-a-skin/) for instructions on how to create and build skins for TinyMCE.

## Building the skins
The build process uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure you have both installed before you continue.

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
2. Build the skins with `yarn build`.
3. To view the skins, run `yarn start` in this repository and go to `http://localhost:4000`.
