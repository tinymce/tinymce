// There are numerous problems with Google Keyboard when we need to switch focus back from a toolbar item / dialog to
// the content for editing. The major problem is to do with autocomplete. Android Google Keyboard (not Swift) seems to
// remember the things that you've typed into the input, and then adds them to whatever you type in the content once you give it
// focus, as long as the keyboard has stayed up.

// We tried turning autocomplete off, and then turning it back on again with a setTimeout, and although it fixed the problem,
// the autcomplete on didn't start working immediately. Maurizio also pointed out that it was probably keyboard specific
// (and he was right) autocomplete off, and then turn it back on in an attempt to stop this happening. It works, but the
// autocomplete on part takes a while to start working again.

// Then we tried everyone's favourite setTimeout solution. This appears to work because it looks like the bug might
// be caused by the fact that the autocomplete cache is maintained while in the same event queue. As soon as we
// disconnect the stack, it looks like it is fixed. That makes some level of sense.

    // If we don't blur before focusing the content, a previous focus in something like a statebutton
    // which represents the chosen font colour can stop the keyboard from appearing. Therefore, we blur
    // first.
