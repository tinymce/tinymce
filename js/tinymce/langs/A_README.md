README for Teamup Calendar

Language files downloaded from https://www.tinymce.com/download/language-packages/

The following mappings are needed to map the language codes used by TinyMCE to the langauge codes use by Teamup:

- Copied file fr_FR.js to fr.js because "fr" is the language key we us in Teamup for French.
- Copied file hu_HU.js to hu.js because "hu" is the language key we us in Teamup for Hungarian.
- Copied file nb_NO.js to nb.js because "nb" is the language key we us in Teamup for Norwegian Bokmal.

Note that the first line of each language file needs to be adjusted as well.
