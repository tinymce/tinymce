<P>____________________________________</P>

<P>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
    2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license
    can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that
    ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated
    version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise,
    this version is the same as the <A
        href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720">previous
    version</A> and is written so as to preserve the <A
