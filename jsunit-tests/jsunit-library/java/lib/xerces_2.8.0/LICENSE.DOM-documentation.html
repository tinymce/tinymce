<P>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
    2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license
    can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information
    on style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the <A
        href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ">Copyright FAQ</A>, reflects
    that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated
    version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". See the <A
        href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents-19990405">older
    formulation</A> for the policy prior to this date. Please see our <A
        href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ">Copyright FAQ</A> for common
    questions about using materials from our site, such as the translating or
    annotating specifications. Other questions about this notice can be directed to
