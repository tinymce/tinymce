See Tags on GitHub.\n\nOr in a Node.js application via the package manager:\n\n    npm install escodegen\n\n### Usage\n\nA simple example: the program\n\n    escodegen.generate({\n        type: 'BinaryExpression',\n        operator: '+',\n        left: { type: 'Literal', value: 40 },\n        right: { type: 'Literal', value: 2 }\n    });\n\nproduces the string `'40 + 2'`\n\nSee the [API page](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen/wiki/API) for\noptions. To run the tests, execute `npm test` in the root directory.\n\n### License\n\n#### Escodegen\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 [Yusuke Suzuki](http://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](http://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.
