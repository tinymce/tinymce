  "readme": "JSHint, A Static Code Analysis Tool for JavaScript\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[ [Use it online](http://jshint.com/) •  [About](http://jshint.com/about/) • \n[Docs](http://jshint.com/docs/) • [FAQ](http://jshint.com/docs/faq) • \n[Install](http://jshint.com/install/) • [Hack](http://jshint.com/hack/) • \n[Blog](http://jshint.com/blog/) • [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jshint/) \\]\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshint/jshint.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshint/jshint)\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jshint.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/jshint)\n\nJSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems\nin JavaScript code and to enforce your team’s coding conventions. It is\nvery flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines\nand the environment you expect your code to execute in.\n\n#### JSHint 2.x versus JSHint 3\n\nThere's an effort going on to release the next major version of JSHint. All\ndevelopment in the `master` branch is for the version 3.0. Current stable\nversion is in the `2.x` branch. Keep that in mind when submitting pull requests.\n\nAlso, before reporting a bug or thinking about hacking on JSHint, read this:\n[JSHint 3 plans](http://www.jshint.com/blog/jshint-3-plans/). TL;DR: we're\nmoving away from style checks within JSHint so no new features around\nstyle checks will be accepted. Bug fixes are fine for the `2.x` branch.\n\n#### Reporting a bug\n\nTo report a bug simply create a\n[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe\nyour problem or suggestion. We welcome all kind of feedback regarding\nJSHint including but not limited to:\n\n * When JSHint doesn't work as expected\n * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers\n * When you simply want a new option or feature\n\nBefore reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets\nthat cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.\n\n\n#### License\n\nJSHint is distributed under the MIT License. One file and one file only\n(src/stable/jshint.js) is distributed under the slightly modified MIT License.\n\n\n#### Thank you!\n\nWe really appreciate all kind of feedback and contributions. Thanks for using and supporting JSHint!\n",
