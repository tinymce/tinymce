	or will be corrected, that any such correction can or will be made in a timely
	manner, that the software will operate in the combinations which you may select
	for your use, will produce the results you desire, or that the software

	shall be limited to fifty dollars (USD $50).  In no event shall Ephox be liable
	for costs of procurement of substitute goods or technology, loss of profits, or
	for any indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, consequential or incidental
	damages, however caused, whether for breach of warranty, breach of contract,
	repudiation of contract, negligence or otherwise, even if Ephox has been advised
	of the possibility of such damages.
	
	In no event will Ephox be liable for fines or penalties imposed on you.
	Furthermore, Ephox disclaims any liability for loss of or inaccuracy of your
	data or the data maintained by you on behalf of others. Ephox also disclaims
	liability or responsibility for violations of applicable privacy laws and
	regulations, or for breaches of security of hardware, software or systems for
	which it is hereby agreed that you shall have sole and exclusive responsibility.
	You agree that Ephox will not be liable for loss of or damage to goodwill or
	"costs of cover" (including, without limitation, costs of procuring substitute
	products or services) which arise directly or indirectly out of the purchase,
	sale, use of and/or inability to use of software provided in connection with
	this agreement whether such damages are based upon contract, tort, intentional
	conduct, equity or pursuant to some other theory, including, without limitation,
	breach of warranty, negligence or strict liability, whether the possibility of
	such damages was made known to or was foreseeable by Ephox and whether such
	damages are asserted by you or some other party.
	
	You agree to assume the responsibility for insuring against or otherwise bearing
	the risk of damages in excess of the liability of Ephox.  The limitations of
	liability set forth herein are intended to limit Ephox’s liability and will
	apply notwithstanding the failure of the essential purpose of any remedy.  
	Any action, claim or proceeding relating to these terms and conditions, and the
	software provided in connection with the agreement or the transactions
	contemplated by the terms and conditions of said agreement, must be brought
	within twelve (12) months following the action or event giving rise to such
	action, claim or proceeding. 
	
	You agree to use reasonable efforts to mitigate any damages sustained by you
	pursuant to or in connection with the use of or your inability to use the
	software provided in connection with this agreement.  
	
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the disclaimer of warranties and/or the
	disclaimer and/or limitation of damages will not be deemed to disclaim liability
	specifically imposed on Ephox by statute or regulation, to the extent such
	liability cannot be waived or disclaimed.  
	
	Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the
	exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so
	the disclaimers or limitations set forth herein may not fully apply to you.  To
	the extent that the disclaimers and/or limitations set forth herein are not
	fully enforceable under applicable law, you may have other legal rights which
	vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

10.	Remedies for Infringement

	In the event that Ephox reasonably believes that the Software may be subject to
	an infringement claim, Ephox may, at its opinion, either: (1) substitute
	substantially equivalent non-infringing Software; (2) modify the infringing item
	so that it no longer infringes but remains substantially equivalent; (3) if none
	of the foregoing is commercially feasible, Ephox may terminate the license
	granted hereunder.
	
	THIS SECTION STATES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS OF
	INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.

	rights hereunder shall be effective unless and until the purported assignee
